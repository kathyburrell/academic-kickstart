Kathy is a Reader in Human Geography with interests in migration, especailly aspects relating to mobility, memory, material culture and cultural representation, and is a specialist in Polish migration particularly. She is currently working on an international project funded by the Research Council of Norway on the experiences of Poles in the UK, Sweden and Norway (http://famac-project.com/) and is writing about Brexit and Polish migration, as well as the relationships migrants have with the state in these different countries. Kathy has also been writing about graphic narratives of the European 'refugee crisis'.

Before she moved to Liverpool in 2013 Kathy was Reader in Migration and Material Culture at De Montfort University in Leicester. She was awarded her AHRB-funded PhD on postwar Polish, Italian and Greek-Cypriot migration to the UK at the University of Leicester in 2004. Kathy also did her BA and MA degrees at Leicester, graduating in 1998 with a BA in Politics and Economic & Social History (First Class Hons), and an MA in English Local History in 2000.
